An
 
Ignatian
 
AI
 
Augmentation
 
Agent
 
for
 
Supporting

Job

and
 
Vocational

Since
 
the

AI's
 
scope
 
in
 
supporting
 
business

has
 
grown
 
exponentially,
 
opening
 
the
 
door
 
to
 
a
 
wide
 
range
 
of
 
creative
 
and
 
innovative
 
applications.

In
 
this
 
project,
 
we
 
aim
 
to
 
harness
 
that
 
potential
 
to
 
develop
 
an
 
AI
 
augmentation
 
agent
 
grounded
 
in
 
the
 
Ignatian
 
Pedagogical
 
Paradigm
 
(IPP),
 
a
 
model
 
rooted
 
in
 
reflection,
 
discernment,
 
and
 
holistic
 
growth.

This
 
agent
 
helps
 
students
 
identify
 
and
 
prepare
 
for
 
career
 
paths
 
that
 
match
 
their
 
passions,
 
values,
 
and
 
unique
 
personalities,
 
while
 
meeting
 
the
 
real-world
 
demands
 
of
 
prospective
 
employers.

The
 
innovative
 
core
 
of
 
this
 
project
 
lies
 
in
 
how
 
the
 
agent
 
interprets
 
job
 
postings
 
not
 
as
 
static
 
qualifications
 
lists
 
but
 
as
 
dynamic
 
prompts
 
for
 
student-driven
 
portfolio
 
development.

By
 
translating
 
job
 
descriptions
 
into
 
personalized,
 
actionable
 
project
 
ideas,
 
the
 
agent
 
helps
 
students
 
creatively
 
demonstrate
 
competence,
 
initiative,
 
and
 
ethical
 
judgment,
 
qualities
 
that
 
are
 
difficult
 
to
 
convey
 
through
 
traditional
 
resumes
 
and
 
cover
 
letters
 
alone.

For
 
example,
 
when
 
a
 
student
 
targets
 
a
 
marketing
 
data
 
analyst
 
role
 
requiring
 
Tableau
 
skills,
 
the
 
agent
 
might
 
recommend
 
building
 
an
 
interactive
 
Tableau
 
dashboard
 
using
 
public
 
e-commerce
 
data.

The
 
student
 
would
 
track
 
site
 
traffic,
 
segment
 
customers,
 
and
 
analyze
 
repeat
 
purchase
 
trends.

Drawing
 
on
 
IPP
 
principles,
 
the
 
agent
 
would
 
prompt
 
the
 
student
 
to
 
reflect
 
on
 
data
 
ethics
 
and
 
propose
 
a
 
thoughtful,
 
opt-in
 
loyalty
 
program
 
to
 
address
 
low
 
retention.

The
 
end
 
product,
 
an
 
executive
 
summary,
 
a
 
visual
 
dashboard,
 
and
 
a
 
slide
 
presentation,
 
offers
 
a
 
compelling
 
and
 
concrete
 
demonstration
 
of
 
the
 
student’s
 
skills,
 
creativity,
 
and
 
capacity
 
for
 
responsible
 
decision-making.

This
 
approach
 
transforms
 
the
 
job-seeking
 
process
 
from
 
a
 
passive
 
“spray-and-pray”
 
application
 
strategy
 
into
 
an
 
active,
 
imaginative
 
process
 
of
 
professional
 
discernment,
 
guided
 
by
 
Ignatian
 
values.

The
 
central
 
question
 
this
 
project
 
explores
 
is:
 
What
 
is
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
an
 
AI-powered,
 
Ignatian-guided
 
portfolio
 
system
 
in
 
enhancing
 
students’
 
career
 
discernment,
 
vocational
 
confidence,
 
job
 
placement
 
success,
 
and
 
cura
 
personalis
?

SIGNIFICANCE
 
The
 
agent
 
recasts
 
AI
 
as
 
a
 
coach
 
and
 
ally,
 
turning
 
job
 
postings
 
into
 
an
 
opportunity
 
for
 
self-reflection
 
and
 
knowledge
 
development
 
through
 
targeted
 
portfolio
 
projects.

Every
 
interaction
 
walks
 
students
 
through
 
the
 
full
 
IPP
 
cycle,
 
uniting
 
Ignatian
 
principles
 
and
 
work
 
in
 
a
 
measurable,
 
values
‑
grounded
 
journey
 
toward
 
professional
 
purpose.

The
 
framework
 
scales
 
from
 
individual
 
learners
 
to
 
give
 
higher
 
education
 
a
 
mission
‑
centered
 
AI
 
model
 
that
 
helps
 
secure
 
job
 
offers
 
and
 
counters
 
Laudato
 
Si’s
 
"technocratic
 
paradigm"
 
by
 
channeling
 
competence
 
toward
 
the
 
common
 
good
 
and
 
human
 
flourishing.

METHOD
 
We
 
will
 
augment
 
and
 
extend
 
an
 
existing
 
app
 
that
 
can
 
collect
 
students’
 
resumes
 
and
 
target
 
job
 
descriptions.

A
 
prompt
‑
tuned
 
LLM
 
agent
 
would
 
then
 
guide
 
them
 
through
 
the
 
IPP
 
cycle:
 
Context,
 
Experience,
 
Reflection,
 
Action,
 
Evaluation.

The
 
agent
 
would
 
then
 
match
 
employer
 
needs
 
to
 
students'
 
strengths
 
and
 
values
 
and
 
return
 
project
 
requirements,
 
resume
 
edits,
 
and
 
interview
 
prompts.

The
 
project's
 
success
 
will
 
be
 
measured
 
through
 
data
 
collection
 
from
 
embedded
 
Google
 
Analytics
 
in
 
the
 
web
 
app
 
to
 
track
 
engagement
 
patterns,
 
pre
‑
 
and
 
post
‑
surveys
 
capturing
 
shifts
 
in
 
job
‑
readiness,
 
values
 
alignment,
 
project
 
completion,
 
interview
 
invitations,
 
and
 
job
 
offers.

A
 
mixed
‑
methods
 
review
 
of
 
clickstream
 
data
 
and
 
reflection
 
text
 
would
 
inform
 
refinements
 
and
 
yield
 
insights
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
shared
 
across
 
Jesuit
 
institutions.

STATEMENT
 
This
 
project
 
answers
 
Pope Francis’s
 
call
 
for
 
technology
 
that
 
upholds
 
human
 
dignity
 
by
 
using
 
artificial
 
intelligence
 
to
 
guide
 
students
 
toward
 
meaningful
 
work
 
rather
 
than
 
automate
 
them
 
out
 
of
 
it.

The
 
agent
 
pairs
 
each
 
student’s
 
gifts
 
with
 
roles
 
where
 
they
 
can
 
flourish,
 
enabling
 
technology
 
to
 
support
 
personal
 
growth
 
and
 
service
 
to
 
the
 
common
 
good.

Every
 
user
 
journey
 
through
 
the
 
agent
 
traces
 
the
 
full
 
IPP
 
arc
 
(Context,
 
Experience,
 
Reflection,
 
Action,
 
and
 
Evaluation),
 
which
 
helps
 
career
 
decisions
 
emerge

Answer: 
**************************************************
** Response: **
assistant: The provided context information describes an AI augmentation agent project aimed at supporting student job placement and vocational discernment using the Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm (IPP). The goal is to develop a personalized portfolio system that helps students identify career paths matching their passions, values, and unique personalities. 

The innovative core of this project lies in how it interprets job postings as dynamic prompts for student-driven portfolio development. By translating job descriptions into actionable project ideas, the agent assists students in creatively demonstrating competence, initiative, and ethical judgment.

The project's significance is rooted in its ability to recast AI as a coach and ally, turning job postings into an opportunity for self-reflection and knowledge development through targeted portfolio projects. The framework scales from individual learners to higher education, providing a mission-centered AI model that helps secure job offers while counteracting the "technocratic paradigm" by channeling competence towards the common good.

The project's methodology involves augmenting and extending an existing app that can collect students' resumes and target job descriptions. A prompt-tuned LLM agent guides learners through the IPP cycle: Context, Experience, Reflection, Action, Evaluation. The agent matches employer needs to students' strengths and values, returning project requirements, resume edits, and interview prompts.

The project's success will be measured by data collection from embedded Google Analytics in the web app, tracking engagement patterns, pre- and post-surveys capturing shifts in job-readiness, values alignment, project completion, interview invitations, and job offers. A mixed-methods review of clickstream data and reflection text informs refinements and yields insights that can be shared across Jesuit institutions.

The timeline for this project includes feature freeze and pilot preparation (June-July 2025), conference demonstration (July 10-13, 2025), student pilot and iteration (late July-Early August 2025), data collection and analysis (mid-August 2025), dissemination of findings (September 2025).

The project's statement emphasizes its commitment to using artificial intelligence to guide students towards meaningful work rather than automating them out of it. The agent pairs each student's gifts with roles where they can flourish, enabling technology to support personal growth and service to the common good.

In summary, this AI augmentation agent project aims to develop a personalized portfolio system that supports student job placement and vocational discernment using the Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm (IPP). It recasts AI as a coach and ally, turning job postings into an opportunity for self-reflection and knowledge development. The framework scales from individual learners to higher education, providing a mission-centered AI model that helps secure job offers while counteracting the "technocratic paradigm" by channeling competence towards the common good.

TITLE

PROJECT
 
DESCRIPTION
 
An
 
Ignatian
 
AI
 
Augmentation
 
Agent
 
for
 
Supporting
 
Student
 
Job
 
Placement
 
and
 
Vocational
 
Discernment
 
Since
 
the
 
introduction
 
of
 
Large
 
Language
 
Models,
 
AI's
 
scope
 
in
 
supporting
 
business
 
operations
 
and
 
personal
 
development
 
has
 
grown
 
exponentially,
 
opening
 
the
 
door
 
to
 
a
 
wide
 
range
 
of
 
creative
 
and
 
innovative
 
applications.
 
 In
 
this
 
project,
 
we
 
aim
 
to
 
harness
 
that
 
potential
 
to
 
develop
 
an
 
AI
 
augmentation
 
agent
 
grounded
 
in
 
the
 
Ignatian
 
Pedagogical
 
Paradigm
 
(IPP),
 
a
 
model
 
rooted
 
in
 
reflection,
 
discernment,
 
and
 
holistic
 
growth.
 
 This
 
agent
 
helps
 
students
 
identify
 
and
 
prepare
 
for
 
career
 
paths
 
that
 
match
 
their
 
passions,
 
values,
 
and
 
unique
 
personalities,
 
while
 
meeting
 
the
 
real-world
 
demands
 
of
 
prospective
 
employers.
 
 The
 
innovative
 
core
 
of
 
this
 
project
 
lies
 
in
 
how
 
the
 
agent
 
interprets
 
job
 
postings
 
not
 
as
 
static
 
qualifications
 
lists
 
but
 
as
 
dynamic
 
prompts
 
for
 
student-driven
 
portfolio
 
development.
